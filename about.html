        <p1 p = "bio">Our team is Cool Beans and we are composed of three first-year students
            at Stony Brook University: Amelia, Juan, and Jared. This is our first time attending 
            a Hackathon. We come from Queens, NY and are hoping to learn more about programming
             and test our knowledge during this Hackathon.

        <h3 class = "project">About Our Project</h3>
        <p2 p = "aboutProj"> Our intentions with this project were to create an interface that organizes
            patient information in such a way that could be used for hospitals and clinics. The Home page
            displays the various patients that the facility had encountered during its use. The Patient
            Information page is used to insert a new patient and their information into the facility's database.
